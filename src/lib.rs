//! BMP-Rust is a pure Rust library written with no external dependencies (except for the standard library), that can read and write to .BMP files.
//! 
//! Besides the basic reading pixel color and changing pixel color, various filters, blurs, and shapes are implemented.
//! The library can also parse the file header, DIB header and other parts of the file.
//! Many useful utility functions are also included.
